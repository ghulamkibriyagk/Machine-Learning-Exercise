# Machine-Learning-Exercise
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks covering essential machine learning concepts, including Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Random Forest, and model validation techniques for handling underfitting and overfitting. These notebooks are based on exercises from Kaggle, designed to provide hands-on experience in building and evaluating machine learning models.
